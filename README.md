Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want to design?

  They were a company that wanted to fill a niche and create a service that helps people in being more prepared to take a test for their driver's license by offering       scheduled on-the-road training and online practice tests.
  
What did you do particularly well?

  I think I did a very good job at honing my mastery with UML diagrams as well as organizing plans for the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would choose the UML class diagram. I think I did well with it but a classmate posted theirs in the discussion post that made me realize I could've improved the       connections instead of mostly leaving blank lines.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I paid careful attention to the interview with them, which was written in thsi case. In real life, I would make sure to ask plenty of questions and take notes and I     would maintain open communication throughout. It is crucial to maintain focus on the user's needs or the system will fail to meet its purpose.
 
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

  I would analyze the needs of the system, then layout the system plans based on those needs. Afterwards, I would consider the best way to implement them and plan that     out with detailed UML diagrams and then reflect on each need, ensuring it all works. Then, I would code it based on the plans and test each par, ideally with a team of   people to help test it.
